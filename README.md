# Label-Convertor
A program to convert Pascal labels to YOLO

To use this code, you need to have a folder named data in the directory where the code is stored. Inside this folder,
there should be a text file named predefined_classes.txt, where all the classes are listed line by line in order.

Then, by selecting a folder that contains the Pascal labels in XML format and another folder for storing the new labels in TXT format, you can perform the conversion.
